# Conclusions that can be drawn from the data:

The best time to start a campaign is early summer (May) and the worst time to start a campaign is in the fall/early winter (September through January). In relation to the number of failed campaigns, the number of successful campaigns appears low in September through January. Both in overall terms, and in relation to the number of failed campaigns, the number of successful campaigns is highest in May. This may indicate it could be interesting to investigate if certain kickstarter users contribute to multiple campaigns under certain circumstances. 

Most sub-categories either have zero successful campaigns or zero failed campaigns, with the notable exception being ‘plays’. This could be an indication that creating a campaign classified in a sub-category with other successful campaigns may increase the chances the campaign will be successful. 

There appears to be a negative coloration between the funding goal and the percentage of successful campaigns. The campaigns with funding goals under $5,000 are the most successful, and those with goals over $50,000 are the least successful. In general, for each successive $5,000 funding goal increment, the percentage of successful campaigns declines. 

# Limitations to data:

The dataset does not include information about the marketing budget, if any to promote the various campaigns. I would predict that data would show a higher marketing budget would positively correlate both the amount and percentage of the goal that gets funded. The data does not account for the amount of experience in the industry/category/sub-category the sponsor/backer of the campaign has. The data does not give any indication as to how many campaigns each donor gives to. 

# Other possible tables/graphs/displayed information:

It may be useful to see campaign goals compared to the percentage of the goal is funded, filtered by category with the campaign goal being grouped in ranges. It may be useful to chart the amount of time between when a campaign is launched, and the deadline verses the percentage of the goal is raised. Pivot tables comparing the averages of the number of donors for ‘staff picks’ and not-staff pick campaigns (ditto with ‘promoted’ and not promoted campaigns).
